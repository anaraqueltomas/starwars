# Star Wars
Idea, design and implementation of a **platform game**.

This was the product of a 17 hour hackaton that took place at [\<Academia de CÃ³digo_>](http://www.academiadecodigo.org/). It was developed in partnership with other colleagues. Written in Java, using the [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) library for the game development (menus, physics, animation, sound), [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) for the interface and graphics, and git version control to work in collaboration.

Please, take into account that we had only 8 weeks of Java learning by this time.
